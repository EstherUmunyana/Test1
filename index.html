<p><h2><i>‘Phenomenal Woman’.</i></h2> Being <strong>a ‘phenomenal woman’</strong> is not about being a certain size,<br> or a particular shape. It’s about how you carry yourself, and how you behave. As with several other poems on this list of Maya Angelou poems,<br> ‘Phenomenal Woman’ is about being unbowed, about holding one’s head high and being proud of who one is.</p>
<p><h3>You may write</h3><br> me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.
